- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @WalkerBowden95, but if you're looking at this you can just call me Walker.
- You might find me on LinkedIn as Daniel, this is because Daniel is my first name, but I typically go by Walker, my middle name.
- I'm a graduate of the University of Central Arkansas with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science and Engineering.
- As of now I'm looking for a full-time, entry level position as a computer programmer.
- I'm most familiar with C++ and Java, but I also have experience in Python, Lua, and Assembly.
- ðŸ“« The best way to reach me is via email: dwbowden95@gmail.com.
